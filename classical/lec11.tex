\section{Action-Angle Variables}

Consider the Harmonic oscillator
\begin{eqn}
H = \frac{p^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 q^2,
\end{eqn}
where we found that the trajectories in phase space make ellipses centered about the origin. This suggests that we could make a canonical transformation to nice polar coordinates in phase space,
\begin{eqn}
(p,q) \rightarrow (I,\theta), \qquad 
q = \sqrt{\frac{2I}{m\omega}} \sin\theta, \qquad
p = \sqrt{2Im\omega} \cos\theta,
\end{eqn}
This results in a very nice form for the Hamiltonian, $H' = \omega I$, and thus the equations of motion are just
\begin{eqn}
\dot \theta = \omega, \qquad
\dot I = 0.
\end{eqn}
So we can visualize the trajectories as constant motion about a ring on a cylinder, where the ring is at height $I$ and angles are labelled $\theta$. These are called action-angle variables.

Suppose instead we have a system with $N$ degrees of freedom. For certain systems there exists a canonical transformation to a complete set of action-angle variables. This defines a special class of \textit{integrable} systems, for which, more precisely, we have
\begin{eqn}
(q_i, p_i) \rightarrow (I_i, \theta_i), \qquad
H' = \sum_i \omega_i I_i,
\end{eqn}
so that the equations of motion are just
\begin{eqn}
\dot \theta_i = \omega_i, \qquad
\dot I_i = 0.
\end{eqn}
So we have motion in $\theta_i$ on $(S^1)^n = T^n$, the $n$-torus. 

\begin{theorem}[Liouville's theorem]
Suppose we have some canonical coordinates $I_1, \dots, I_N$ with 
\begin{eqn}
\cbr{I_i, H'} = \cbr{I_i, I_j} = 0, \qquad
i,j = 1, \dots, N.
\end{eqn}
Then the system is integrable. 
\end{theorem}

In other words, the system is integrable if there exists a canonical transformation with a complete set of conserved momenta. For example, in the central potential problem we should also have 3 action-angle variables. This also applies to something with infinitely many degrees of freedom like a field theory. 

Integrability is really the exception and not the rule---integral systems are special. Furthermore, integrability is a global property. Consider motion along the phase space in a non-integrable system. Locally, the path looks like a tiny line segment so we can rotate into action-angle variables. Thus any path in phase space is locally integrable in a small neighborhood, but this is not always the case. In an integrable system, we can define action-angle variables globally, in every coordinate patch. 


\subsection{Some Examples}

\begin{itemize}
\item Elementary examples: Harmonic oscillator; Motion in central potential; Spinning top

\item \textit{Toda-lattice}: mass points coupled by nearest neighbor interactions where the Hamiltonian looks like
\begin{equation}
H = \sum_{i = 1}^{N+1} \frac{1}{2} p_1^2 + \omega^2 e^{q_i - q_{i+1}}
\end{equation}
We can link the last to the first one to make a circle and this is the $SU(N)$ lattice. This is hard to solve with conventional methods because exponentials are scary. 

\item \textit{Calogero-Moser} systems, which have an interparticle potential
\begin{equation}
H = \sum_i \frac{1}{2} p_i^2 + \sum_{i\ne j}^N V(q_i - q_j)
\end{equation}
of the form
\begin{equation}
V_1(q) = \frac{1}{q^2}, \quad
V_2(q) = -\frac{4}{\sinh^2 (q/2)}, \quad
\text{or} \quad
V_3(q) = \frac{4}{\sin^2 (q/2)}
\end{equation}

\item Study of integrable systems is a full subfield of mathematical physics especially when applied to field theories

\item The best approach to finding action angle variables and for checking whether a system is integrable is to use the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, onto which we now shift our focus. 

\end{itemize}


\section{Hamilton-Jacobi theory}

Motivations:
\begin{itemize}
\item New formulation of mechanics
\item It gives a practical way to construct action/angle variables (separability) (sometimes)
\item Most efficient way of solving dynamics
\item New way of thinking about the action
\item Geometrical optics / semiclassical approximation (QM)
\end{itemize}

In the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation, we are interested in finding a generating function $F(q,Q,t)$ such that the new Hamiltonian is as simple as possible. What's the simplest Hamiltonian?
\begin{eqn}
K(P,Q,t) \equiv 0.
\end{eqn}
Then $\dot Q = \dot P = 0$ or $Q \equiv \alpha, P \equiv \beta$, so we've just moved the dynamics from the Hamiltonian into the generating function. So we can write, using our results from the generating function formalism,
\begin{eqn}
0 = K(Q_i,P_i,t) = H(p_i,q_i,t) + \pd{F}{t}.
\end{eqn}
This is a canonical transformation of type 1, $F_1 = F$, so we have
\begin{eqn}
p_i = \pd{F}{q_i}, \qquad
P_i = -\pd{F}{Q_i}.
\end{eqn}
Then we can rewrite $K = 0$ as 
\begin{eqn}
H(q_i, \tpd{F(q,Q,t)}{q_i}, t) + \pd{F(q,Q,t)}{t} = 0,
\end{eqn}
which is the \textbf{Hamilton-Jacobi equation} (HJE). As a comparison, recall that Hamilton's equations give us a system of $2N$ first order ODEs. Here in the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, we have a single first order PDE in $N+1$ variables. 

As a first example, let's look at the free particle $H = p^2 / 2m$. Then the HJE can be written
\begin{eqn}
\frac{1}{2m} \left(\pd{F}{q}\right)^2 + \pd{F}{t} = 0.
\end{eqn}
We see that even for a very simple example, we can end up with a difficult problem because we now have a nonlinear PDE. By inspection, we can write down a solution 
\begin{eqn}
F(q,Q,t) = \frac{m(q-Q)^2}{2t},
\end{eqn}
then we find
\begin{eqn}
p = \pd{F}{q} = \frac{m(q-Q)}{t}, \qquad
P = -\pd{F}{Q} = \frac{m(q-Q)}{t}.
\end{eqn}
Recall that $Q$ and $P$ are supposed to be constant---looking at their forms, we notice that $\alpha \equiv Q = q(0)$ and $\beta \equiv P = p(0)$ and we can write
\begin{eqn}
q(t) = \frac{\beta}{m} t + \alpha.
\end{eqn}
Furthermore, $F$ looks familiar:
\begin{eqn}
F = \frac{p(0)^2}{2m} t,
\end{eqn}
it's just the action! 
\begin{eqn}
S = \int_0^t \frac{1}{2} m \dot q^2 \dif{t} = \frac{\beta^2}{2m} t.
\end{eqn}
So we've found that $F$ evaluated on the solution is the action. 

It turns out that this solution is not unique. Another solution is given by
\begin{eqn}
F = q \sqrt{2m\alpha} - \alpha t,
\end{eqn}
so we have
\begin{eqn}
p = \pd{F}{q} = \sqrt{2m \alpha}, \qquad
P = -\pd{F}{\alpha} = \frac{q\sqrt{2m}}{2\sqrt{\alpha}} - t = \beta,
\end{eqn}
or 
\begin{eqn}
q = \sqrt{\frac{2\alpha}{m}} (t+\beta), \qquad
p = \sqrt{2m\alpha}.
\end{eqn}
[Is this an equivalent action? i.e. under an equivalent Lagrangian?]

We can show that indeed $F = S$. Given the action
\begin{eqn}
S[q(t)] = \int_0^t \dif{t'} \, L(q, \dot q, t'),
\end{eqn}
the variation is just
\begin{eqn}
\delta S = \int_0^t \cancelto{0}{\left( \pd{L}{q} - \od{}{t} \pd{L}{\dot q} \right)} \delta q + \pd{L}{\dot q} \delta q \Big|_0^t 
	= p \Big|_t \delta q \Big|_t
\end{eqn}
so that $\tpd{S}{q|_t} = p |_t$. Furthermore
\begin{eqn}
L = \od{S}{t} = \pd{S}{t} + \pd{S}{q_t} \od{q_t}{t} \big|_t
\end{eqn}
gives us
\begin{eqn}
L(q, \dot q, t) |_t = \pd{S}{t} + p |_t \od{q}{t} \big|_t 
\end{eqn}
so that
\begin{eqn}
\pd{S}{t} = - \left[ p \dot q - L(q, \dot q, t) \right]
\end{eqn}
and thus
\begin{eqn}
\pd{S}{t} = -H(p,q,t) = -H(\pd{S}{q}, q, t),
\end{eqn}
which is just the HJE.
