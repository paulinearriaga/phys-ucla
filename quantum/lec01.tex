What the course is \textbf{not}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Will not motivate QM. You should have motivation by now.
\item Will not be overly mathematically rigorous. Only need a certain level of physical rigor. 
\item Will not give historical or philosophical perspective. 
\end{itemize}

What the course will cover:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Intro
\begin{enumerate}
\item Hilbert spaces
\item Quantum numbers
\item \underline{Uncertainty principle}
\item Correspondence principle --- establishes link between QM and classical mechanics
\end{enumerate}
\item Quantum dynamics
\begin{enumerate}
\item Schroedinger vs Heisenberg picture
\item Feynman path integrals --- establishes connection with principle of least action, Lagrangian mechanics
\item Gauge transformations --- establishes connection with E\&M
\end{enumerate}
\item Rotations
\begin{enumerate}
\item Spin and orbital angular momentum
\item Addition of angular momentum
\item Bell inequalities --- relatively recent. Show that there are measurements that prove classical description is incomplete. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

221B will cover symmetries, approximations, scattering theory. 221C will cover applications with many (identical) particles and fundamentals needed for quantum field theory. 


\subsection{Hilbert spaces}

A Hilbert space $G$ is a complete inner product space. One example is Euclidean space $\mathbb{E}^n$, that is, $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the standard inner product $\braket{x}{y} = \v{x} \cdot \v{y} = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i$. Of course $\mathbb{R}^n$ itself is a vector space. We will define what completeness means later. 

We should define the inner product. The inner product $\braket{x}{y}$ between vectors $x$ and $y$ in $G$ is a complex number such that: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\braket{x}{y} = \braket{y}{x}^*$,
\item Linearity: $\braket{x}{\alpha_1 y_1 + \alpha_2 y_2} = \alpha_1 \braket{x}{y_1} + \alpha_2 \braket{x}{y_2}$ for any scalars $\alpha_1, \alpha_2 \in \mathbb{C}$, and
\item Positivity: $\braket{x}{x} \geq 0$ with equality iff $x = 0$.
\end{enumerate}

Define the distance 
\begin{equation}
d(x, y) = d(y, x) = \norm{x - y} = \sqrt{\braket{x - y}{x - y}}.
\end{equation}
Need to prove this is a good distance function. In particular, we need the triangle inequality: $d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)$. Mathematicians would call this a metric space. Can prove the triangle inequality with the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality:
\begin{equation}
\abs{\braket{x}{y}} \leq \norm{x} \cdot \norm{y}.
\end{equation}
We can prove this as follows. Define 
\begin{equation}
z = x - y \frac{\braket{y}{x}}{\braket{y}{y}},
\end{equation}
then 
\begin{equation}
x = z + y \frac{\braket{y}{x}}{\braket{y}{y}}
\end{equation}
so $\norm{x}^2 = \norm{z}^2 + \norm{y}^2 (\dots)^2$ by Pythagorean theorem, thus
\begin{equation}
\norm{x}^2 \norm{y}^2 = \norm{z}^2 \norm{y}^2 + \abs{\braket{y}{x}}^2
\end{equation}
and we see equality occurs iff $z = 0$ i.e. $x \parallel y$

Now we can define completeness of a metric space $G$. Define a Cauchy sequence $x_i \in G$, $i = 1,2,\dots$ as a sequence such that for any $\delta > 0$ there exists an integer $N > 0$ so that $\norm{x_n - x_m} < \delta$ for all $m, n > N$. The space $G$ is complete if every Cauchy sequence converges. Good, now we've defined a Hilbert space. 

Now, the universe itself is a Hilbert space. Or rather, physical realizations of the universe are elements of a Hilbert space. A quantum mechanical state $\psi$ is represented by a vector in a Hilbert space. We will be interested in the preparation, measurement, and evolution of this state. 

As $\psi(t)$ evolves, it must remain in $G$. Furthermore, the physical state $\psi$ must be properly normalized: $\braket{\psi}{\psi} = 1$ at all times. Dirac's bracket notation provides us with a good way of dealing with elements of the Hilbert space and the dual space. 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\ket{\psi} \in G$ is the ket, the representation in the Hilbert space
\item $\bra{\psi} \in G$ is the bra, the representation in the dual space. The bra is a linear map $\bra{\psi} : G \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ mapping kets $\ket{\phi} \mapsto \braket{\psi}{\phi}$. 
\end{itemize}
For each Hilbert space $G$ there is a dual (Hilbert) space $G^*$. Bras, the elements of $G^*$, are defined by their action on the kets in $G$. Note that we have
\begin{equation}
\braket{c_1 \psi_1 + c_2 \psi_2}{\phi} = c_1^* \braket{\psi_1}{\phi} + c_2^* \braket{\psi_2}{\phi},
\end{equation}
so that
\begin{equation}
\bra{c_1 \psi_1 + c_2 \psi_2} = c_1^* \bra{\psi_1} + c_2^* \bra{\psi_2}. 
\end{equation}

A Hilbert space can be spanned by an orthonormal basis $\ket{\alpha_i}$, $i = 1,2, \dots$, i.e. $\braket{\alpha_i}{\alpha_j} = \delta_{ij}$. We can find an orthonormal basis via the Gram-Schmidt method as follows. Suppose we have a complete set of linearly independent states $\ket{u_i}$. Define a normal vector $e_1 = u_1 / \norm{u_1}$. Next define $v_2 = u_2 - P_{e_1}(u_2)$ where we use the projection operator $P_e(v) = \ket{e} \braket{e}{v}$, and finally $e_2 = v_2 / \norm{v_2}$. We can see that $e_1$ and $e_2$ form an orthonormal set so we continue this process ad infinitum to obtain the full orthonormal basis, i.e. $v_{i+1} = u_{i+1} - P_{e_i}(u_{i+1})$ and $e_{i+1} = v_{i+1} / \norm{v_{i+1}}$ for all $i > 1$. 

Any state $\psi$ can be written in the basis: $\ket{\psi} = \sum_i c_i \ket{\alpha_i}$. Note that the coefficients can be obtained by taking the inner product with the corresponding orthonormal basis vector: $\braket{\alpha_i}{\psi} = \sum_j c_j \delta_{ij} = c_i$. Since $c_i = \braket{\alpha_i}{\psi}$, we can write $\ket{\psi} = \sum_i \ket{\alpha_i} \braket{\alpha_i}{\psi}$, thus we find
\begin{equation}
\sum_i \ket{\alpha_i} \bra{\alpha_i} = 1.
\end{equation}
We call this the closure relation.
